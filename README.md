# Hello Graph API

Python 3

This is pretty specific to my needs but is generic as much as I could think to be.

## Dependencies

```pip install -U -r requirements.txt```

## Running

```python hello_graph_api.py path/to/config.ini```

The script will follow all nextLink links, to interrupt just Ctrl+break to
output what has been gathered.
